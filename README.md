# ToDo Redux App

## Hayley Pyle

This is a website that can make a to do list for the user. 
- The user can add and delete to do list items, as well as mark them complete and incomplete.
- The user can filter the list by complete, incomplete, and also show all to do list items.
- The user can submit the contact form for any comments they have. 
- This website uses .html, .css, react.js, and redux.js.
- Future improvements that can be made to this website would be:
    - The user can edit a to do item.
    - The user can categorize to do items and filter by categories. 
    - The user can assign a due date for a to do item.
